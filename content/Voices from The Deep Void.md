## A Free Verse
---
The sonic boom from the supersonic jets growls up  
Overpowering the voice of millions of ants  
Screaming at the top of their voices,  
Screaming in pain!  
Screams of agony and despair!  
  

Moving a kilometer is a big deal  
Searching food for their community;  
Rations of the imminent winter..  
A millions of tireless feet - feets scuttering to stock piles   
That gets them through a ghastly cold;  
They have their burrows not so deep in the ground  
Sheltering under the permafrost - six months a pop!   
   

Still the booms growls   
The jet travelling kilometers in a matter of minutes!  
The splurge of champagne on faces of a select few.  
Cavier and roasted beef;  
Excesses in all their own right!  
Who gets to thrive?    
  

The crashing sound is witnessed hunderds of miles across!  
Leading clouds of empty void crashing onto itself.  
Who do you hear o king?
Whose voices ring thy mortal eardrums?  
  

Do the ants have any less right   
Over lands, their mountains and valleys and fields?   
**Who takes a call on**  
WHAT IS PROGRESS?   
Some green numbers on the blips of a gigantic screen   
Or the voices of netherland left untold?    
  

The gorges from the void grows deeper  
Fathoms at a time unflickered;   
What do you do about these fathoms?  
What will make these two ends meet??  
  

Says a scientist with a towel around his waist,  
emerging from a giant hot tub of bath:    
"I will put in a log of a log to the signal  
That makes the curves stratight and their voices neat!"  
  

And yet,  
The axe looms high  
Hanging by a tout string of obstinacy;  
What is hearing but not understanding?   
What is understanding but not empathy??
